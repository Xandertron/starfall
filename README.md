all of them work, aimbot is a shitty aimbot 

fft visualizer is a visualizer, use some mp3 url

speed test just forces clients to count to some number, last i remember it was 1 million

prime checker tests a shit ton of numbers to find primes, nothing is done other than to slow down the server, it does have multiple outputs for numbers per second, primes per second, and the prime, it gets fucky after 100 thousand so good luck
